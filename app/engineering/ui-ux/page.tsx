        UI/UX might be the most controversial aspect of engineering. Generally,
        it is left as an afterthought in the engineering process.

        Some people might even think that UI and UX are the same thing. However,
        you could have a UX expert who creates an awful-looking UI, while the
        overall user experience remains top-tier. Personally, my strengths shine
        more on the UX side of things, though I do enjoy designing UI from time
        to time.
