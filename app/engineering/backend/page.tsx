      <p>I'll start by saying... I am not a backend developer. I do write Node.js code... but I am not backend. I do write Python... but I am not backend. Okay... maybe I am a little backend.</p>
      <p>In my career there have been lots of interesting problems to solve, and sometimes the solutions for those problems were significantly easier to implement on the backend. In fact some solution must be on the backend. There are plenty of example of sensitive data operations that simply cannot be done on the frontend without risking security.</p>
      <p>In therms of web development, I do think the future lies mostly in frontend, at least as it pertains to performance. Our computers are getting faster and more power efficient every year.</p><p>I do think in this modern age of cloud computing we don't rely on the client side nearly as much as we should. That being said, there will always be a balance between frontend and backend... I just prefer to think in a frontend state of mind.</p>
