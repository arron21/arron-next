        I'll start by saying... I am not a backend developer. I do write Node.js
        code... but I am not a backend developer. I do write Python... but I am
        not a backend developer. Okay... maybe I am a little bit of a backend
        developer.

        Throughout my career, I've encountered many interesting problems to
        solve, and sometimes the solutions were significantly easier to
        implement on the backend. In fact, some solutions must be on the
        backend. There are many examples of sensitive data operations that
        simply cannot be done on the frontend without risking security.

        In terms of web development, I believe the future mostly lies in the
        frontend, especially concerning performance. Our computers are getting
        faster and more power-efficient every year.

        I do think that in this modern age of cloud computing, we don't rely on
        the client side nearly as much as we should. That being said, there will
        always be a balance between frontend and backend. I just prefer to think
        in a frontend state of mind.
