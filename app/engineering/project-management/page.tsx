            <p>I believe that project management has less to do with telling people what to, and more to do with people telling me what to do.</p>
            <p>What I mean is that morale and teamwork are what really matter. Steve Jobs once said <strong>"If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions, and you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy"</strong>. I believe once you develop a culture of trust and respect, you can achieve great things.</p>
