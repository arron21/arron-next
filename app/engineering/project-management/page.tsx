        The best code I have seen has been created as a result of enthusiasm and
        collaboration.

        Morale and teamwork are what really matter. Steve Jobs once said{" "}
        <strong>
          "If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you,
          you have to let them make a lot of decisions, and you have to be run
          by ideas, not hierarchy"
        </strong>
        . I believe once you develop a culture of trust and respect, you can
        achieve great things.
