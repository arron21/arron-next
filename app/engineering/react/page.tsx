        <p>React... this website is built with React and Next.js.</p><p>I'll admit I am not a big fan of React. I prefer the syntax of other frameworks like Angular and Vue. React is still incredibly popular and will probably remain so for a long time. I believe it approaches frontend development in a way that just feels... strange. While I will continue to use React, I will always advocate for a different approach first.</p>
