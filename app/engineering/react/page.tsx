        <p>React... this website is built with React and Next.js.</p><p>I'll admit I am not a big fan or React. I just prefer the syntax of other frameworks like Angular, and Vue. React is still incredibly popular and probably will stay that way for a long time. I believe that it approaches frontend development in a way that that is just feels... strange. I will continue to use React, but I will always advocate for a different approach first.</p>
