    <h1 className="text-4xl my-8">Angular</h1>
    <p>I remember back in 2013 when my team was tasked with architecting a new application. We were moving away from Laravel and wanted to implement a modern front end. I had to choose between React and AngularJS (Angular 2 wasn't available yet). I chose AngularJS because I liked the syntax and it was built by Google. As a Google fanboy, it was a natural choice.</p>
    <p>Angular has changed a lot since 2013, evolving from AngularJS to just Angular. In 2023, the standalone component syntax was released, making the requirement for modules a thing of the past. It's my favorite framework, mostly due to my familiarity with it, but also because it is opinionated.</p>
    <p>Being a strongly opinionated framework means that we, as developers, don't need to reinvent the wheel on every project.</p>
