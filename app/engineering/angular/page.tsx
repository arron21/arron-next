    <h1 className="text-4xl my-8">Angular</h1>
    <p>I remember back in 2013 when my team was tasked with architecting a new application. We were moving away from Laravel and we wanted to implement a modern front end. I had to choose between React and Angular JS(Angular 2 wasn't a thing yet). I chose Angular because I liked the syntax and it was built at Google. Being a Google fanboy it was a natural choice.</p>
    <p>Angular has changed a lot since 2013; it evolved from Angular JS to just Angular. In 2023 the standalone component syntax was released making the requirement of modules a thing of the past. Its my favorite framework mostly due to my familiarity with it but also because it is opinionated.</p>
    <p>Being a strong opinionated framework means that we are developers don't need to reinvent the wheel on every project.</p>
