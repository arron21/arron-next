        <h1 className="text-4xl my-8">Frontend</h1>
        <p>Frontend development has evolved so much since I began my career. The term frontend used to just mean HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Nowadays, it encompasses a wide range of technologies and tools. Some of hte technologies start to to blend more into the backend, such as Node.js which is technically a runtime for JavaScript but for the backend.</p>
        <p>I still stay passionate about the frontend, even with all the changes. I would still consider myself a frontend developer, even if the field and my skills learn more towards the full stack.</p>
