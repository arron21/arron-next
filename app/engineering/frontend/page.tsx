      <p>
        Frontend development has evolved significantly since I began my career.
        The term "frontend" used to mean just HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
        Nowadays, it encompasses a wide range of technologies and tools. Some of
        these technologies start to blend more into the backend, such as
        Node.js, which is technically a runtime for JavaScript but used for
        backend development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remain passionate about the frontend, even with all the changes. I
        still consider myself a frontend developer, even if the field and my
        skills lean more towards full stack.
