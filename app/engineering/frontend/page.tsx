        "Frontend development has undergone tremendous evolution since I embarked on my career. In the early days, being a frontend developer primarily meant working with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. Today, it encompasses a rich array of technologies and tools, many of which blur the lines with backend development. For instance, Node.js, originally just a JavaScript runtime, has become a powerful tool for building backend applications.",
        "Despite these changes, my passion for frontend development remains unwavering. While my skills have expanded and I am now recognized as a full stack developer, my heart is still rooted in the frontend. I take pride in my ability to create seamless user experiences, but I also embrace the full stack landscape, allowing me to build comprehensive applications that thrive on both ends.",
