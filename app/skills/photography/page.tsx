            <p>My photography is often what catches my eye. The juxtaposition of nature and human made objects is what I find interesting. We build tall sky scrapers so we can see beyond the trees. We build televisions so we can watch birds inside of a box.</p>
            <p>I try to capture the balance between our human existence and the existence of Earth itself.</p>
